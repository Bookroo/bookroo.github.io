They say silence is golden. But as a mother of two young boys, I also know silence can mean mischief. You know what I’m talking about, right? You’re getting ready or taking care of some work while your kids are playing in their bedroom. One moment you hear a complete raucous, then you get lost in your project only to realize after a few minutes that the house has become eerily quiet. Suddenly you’re suspicious and even concerned. “Oh no, what are they doing? Climbing somewhere they shouldn’t? Playing in spilled milk? Out the door?”

This morning I had such an experience. I was trying to wrap up a couple of things so I could head out on errands with my boys. But I was struggling–surprise, surprise–to get things done with the boys being their wild selves. I was just making sure the diaper bag was fully stocked when I realized that things had gotten quiet for the last few minutes. Suspiciously concerned, I hurried over to their bedroom door and peeked in, more than a little nervous at what I might find.

Yet inside was a sight to warm any mother’s heart: my two little towheads, sprawled out on their tummies, books scattered around them, reading (or at least looking at pictures). I was so pleasantly surprised to find them engaged in this wholesome, self-initiated activity. It had to have been sent from heaven, because it was just what I needed to put a smile on my face and take a moment to feel like maybe I was doing alright as a mom after all.

Once we were out the door, one of our errands included a stop at the library. Yes, even as co-founders of Bookroo, we most certainly are faithful patrons of our local library. You really can’t have enough books in the house! Plus my boys love music time!

After we spent a few minutes browsing the aisles and had our arms loaded up with our latest selections, we headed up to the counter to check out. As we were loading our books into our tote, our librarian introduced us to the library’s “1000 Books Before Kindergarten” program. The name is pretty self-explanatory, but the goal is to encourage kids to read 1,000 books before they start kindergarten. (They said it can even be the same book 100 times–they must know my boys!)

I loved being challenged to reach this goal and definitely signed my boys up for it. I’m pretty sure we would have read 1,000 books before kindergarten anyway, but it’s more exciting when we’ve challenged ourselves to do it!

One of my favorite quotes about goals comes from a great leader named M. Russell Ballard. He said, “I am so thoroughly convinced that if we don’t set goals in our life and learn how to master the techniques of living to reach our goals, we can reach a ripe old age and look back on our life only to see that we reached but a small part of our full potential. When one learns to master the principles of setting a goal, he will then be able to make a great difference in the results he attains in this life.” While I haven’t mastered setting and accomplishing goals, I feel great when I make the effort to actually set and commit to a goal. So I’m excited about doing this book challenge with my boys.

And thanks to the free Bookroo Reading App, tracking the number of books we read together over the next few years will be easy and convenient! I won’t have to try to keep track of a paper form or worry about it getting lost or ruined. I can just pull up the app and log how many books and how long we’ve read. I can even create a separate profile for each of my boys so I can track their reading individually. I’m admittedly biased, but I think it’s an awesome tool. (I’d love to know how you’ve liked the app in the comments below!)

So here’s to summer reading and our journey toward 1,000 books. I’m sure learning fascinating things about tractors, bugs, and green eggs and ham awaits.

_We’d love to hear your goals and all about the books you are reading. Especially this summer!  With plenty of books around, hopefully those quiet moments in our homes will continue to be good ones, and not the kind we all worry about._
