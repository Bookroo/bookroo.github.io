## Happy Halloween!

Aren’t holidays the best? I love a good reason to celebrate.

This Halloween I have decorated our house with our board and picture books. It has been so fun to have them out around the house. My boys love reading them. I am sure when Halloween is over I will be putting these books away with the decorations, because who likes to read Halloween books on Valentine’s Day? Well, lets be real, my boys do. I don’t. So I think that will help solve that problem.

As I plan to put them away, this also will clear the shelf for some more great books throughout the year.  Which is clearly a problem for many of us. Too many books. Although, our family did just move and as I was unpacking our books and putting them on the shelves, I was sure I had missed some. I searched for another box that could possibly be the books I was certain we had, but I never found any. I realized we certainly didn’t have too many books, and in my opinion, we didn’t have nearly enough.  Books for every time of the year is the way we like it, and we are still working on our collection after nearly two years.

Today we are going to share some of our favorite Halloween books. If you didn’t see our Frankenstein Friday post, by Jane, you’ll have to check it out. It features the books we sent this Halloween which are so fun, as well as some last minute Halloween ideas! I’ll be sharing a few of the books my boys have been enjoying lately as well as some of the favorites of our Bookroo Crew. And then of course, we will want to know your favorites!

## Some of my boys’ favorites from our home:

- **Ollie’s Halloween** by Olivier Dunrea
- **Boo Bunny** by Kathryn O. Galbraith
- **Where’s Boo** by Salina Yoon
- **10 Trick–or–Treaters** by Janet Schulman
- **Bedtime for Monsters** by Ed Vere
- **Room on the Broom** by Julia Donaldson
- **The Widow’s Broom** by Christ Van Allsburg (This is an old one, but definitely one to look up).

## These are some of our favorite Halloween library books from this year:

- **Turkey Trick or Treat** by Wendi Silvano (We went to storytime at the library and my 3 year old shouted out, “we have that book!” He was so excited to recognize it.)
- **Monster Needs a Costume** by Paul Czajak
- **Waltz of the Scarecrows** by Constance W. McGeorge & Mary Whyte
- **The Sweetest Witch Around** by Alison McGhee (I tell you what, I am absolutely sure that reading books gives my kids quite the imaginations, and they also have become quite the dreamers of what should be possible. I think from this book, my boy realized he should be able to have a Halloween costume that can fly! Wait until you hear what he wants for Christmas and for his birthday–good old Dr. Seuss gives great ideas :))

## Bookroo Crew Favorites

- I think we all agree that **Harry Potter** by JK Rowling is an all time classic and favorite book for Halloween, or anytime of the year.
- Nearly all of us have read Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. I am very glad I read it. But it was my first time reading through an entire tragedy and I kept telling Chandler that if it didn’t end well I was going to be very upset. He had to keep reminding me that it was a tragedy.
- **Dracula** by Bram Stoker was very intense. We really enjoyed reading it, but were surprised by the abrupt ending.
- **Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde** by Robert Louis Stevenson is a very short and fun read.
- **The Raven** by Edgar Allan Poe
- **The Tell-Tale Heart** by Edgar Allan Poe
- **The Pit and the Pendulum** by Edgar Allan Poe
- **The Hound of the Baskervilles** by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
- Other Sherlock Holmes Stories
- Agatha Christie is another good author to look for who has written detective and crime novels.

Did we miss some of your favorites? If so we’d love to hear what they are! We are always up for some more good books.
