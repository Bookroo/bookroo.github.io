We did a really great job of having date night before baby F was born--when there's just the two of you pretty much every night is date night as we define it now--but now that we've got a munchkin, if we want a night out on the town, we need a babysitter. While there's really no better babysitter than grandma, we polled our community to see which literary character YOU'd like to babysit your kids. Here's what you said.


Hermione

Hagrid

Dobby

Mrs. Weasley

Katniss

The Cat in the Hat

Balou

Fern

Mary Poppins
