We did a really great job of having date night before baby F was born--when there's just the two of you pretty much every night is date night as we define it now--but now that we've got a munchkin, if we want a night out on the town, we need a babysitter. While there's really no better babysitter than grandma, we polled our community to see which literary character YOU'd like to babysit your kids. Here's what you said.
