Happy (almost) 4th of July! We love this holiday that celebrates our freedom and honors those who have served, will serve, and are currently serving to protect this country and those freedoms. 
 
We wanted to pay special tribute this 4th of July to those who are serving in the armed forces. These are men and women who sacrifice for all of us, and we want to help make their lives and the lives of their families a little bit easier.
 
To do that, we're celebrating #reading2gether. 
 
This 4th of July, if you purchase a 1- or 3-month [children's book subscription](https://bookroo.com/ "bookroo.com"), 50% of the profit will be donated to United Through Reading. This nonprofit is dedicated to uniting U.S. military families facing physical separation by facilitating the bonding experience of reading aloud together through video recording.
