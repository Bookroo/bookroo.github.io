title: 6 Book Characters You Wish Would Come to Life

If you follow us on Facebook, you’ve probably seen our ***FREE BOX FRIDAY*** posts, where we poll our fantastic community on fun, book related questions and send a free Bookroo box to our favorite answer. Which book character would you like to come to life for a day? Here’s what 6 of our community members thought.

### Molly Weasley
_...She could help me finish unpacking boxes from moving (way too long ago) and cook a bunch of delicious food! - Melinda C._

With kids around (toddlers or teenagers!) there’s no doubt that Molly’s delightfully loving and motherly personality is one we’d love to have around. Her magical cooking, cleaning and laundry skills would also be a major bonus, plus, who wouldn’t want a lovely chat with Molly over a cup of tea?


### Winnie the Pooh
_...I would take my little grandson by the hand and take Pooh bears in my other. Then we would go for a magical walk through the Hundred Acre Woods. I'm only a Grandma, but I want my grandson to love reading as much as I do. - Karla A._

We can’t think of a better legacy to pass on than a love of reading, and those stories and characters (like Winnie the Pooh!) that make it through from generation to generation have extra special power.

### Rosie Revere
_...so that my daughter could make inventions with her all day! My daughter is in Kindergarten and recently had a science night at school where they had to build a parachute for four mini marshmallow astronauts. On her first try, three of the "astronauts" fell out and she was a little bummed, but we just said "Your first big flop is over, just like Rosie Revere! Now you can make it better!" And she did! - Annie A._

We honestly hadn’t heard of Rosie before we polled our Facebook community, but absolutely love how many wonderful role models can be found within the pages of children’s books! Who wouldn’t want to introduce their child to their fictional role model? We do!


### Anne of Green Gables
_...It'd be lovely to slow down and see all the world in her glory. - Tabitha G._

Who better to help you see beauty in the little things than darling Anne with an ‘e’? We’d definitely be significantly less productive with Anne around, but every once in a while we all need to step back, think deep thoughts and be amazed at the wonder that surrounds us.

### Mary Poppins
_… We would have an adventure! - Chelsey L. _

Let's face it, she really IS practically perfect in every way and while we agree with Chelsey that Mary Poppins would be fun to go on an adventure with, we'd probably ask her to babysit our kids so we could go on a worry free date night, knowing the kiddos were in excellent hands.
