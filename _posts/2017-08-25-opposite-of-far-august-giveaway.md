Giveaway time! 

We've found such a fun brand to share with you today-- [Opposite of Far](https://oppositeoffar.com/ "Opposite of Far")! This adorable business is owned and run by Jessica Near, who's goal is "to provide the most fun and hours of playtime for kiddos with big imaginations!" They have adorable masks, tails, ears, paws, and other fun items to help itiniate fun, imaginitive play for your children. 

We love Jessica's products, and we thought her Shark and Dog masks would be such a fun giveaway with one of our August picture books, Landshark. Don't you think it looks fun, too? :)
