Hello, fall! 

This is one of my favorite times of the year--time to cuddle up, cozy up, and feel that crisp, cool air on your face. The leaves are changing colors, and we get to enjoy these last few weeks before it's too cold to even try and go outside anymore (yay for winter...)! 

What better way to enjoy this lovely fall season than wearing your baby in your new [Solly Baby](http://sollybaby.com/ "Solly Baby") wrap? We couldn't think of anything, except for if you had some new [Bookroo](https://bookroo.com/ "Bookroo") books for your babe, to go with it. ;) Cuddle up inside and read together, cuddle up and wear your babe outside to enjoy the beautiful fall weather! Or check out our suggestions for [fun fall activities](http://blog.bookroo.com/14-fall-activities-to-do-instead-of-movie-night "14 FALL ACTIVITIES TO DO INSTEAD OF MOVIE NIGHT")!
