We recently read an [article](http://community.today.com/parentingteam/post/actsat-test-prep-tricks-from-a-family-with-three-perfect-scores_1505933651) from a mother with three children in a row who scored perfect scores on the ACT/SAT tests. She shared a list of 16 helpful tips, from cultivating kindness, to learning a new skill, to getting sufficient sleep. All the tips are interesting and make for a worthwhile read, but today we wanted to highlight one tip in particular: Buy books.

"[D]on't forget to buy books," [advised](http://community.today.com/parentingteam/post/actsat-test-prep-tricks-from-a-family-with-three-perfect-scores_1505933651) the mother. "Research proves book owners have smarter children . . . When families own books they are much more likely to all read them and discuss concepts and characters (which is where the real learning begins!)"
