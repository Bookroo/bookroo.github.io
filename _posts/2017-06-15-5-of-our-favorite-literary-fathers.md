_Can you believe it’s already almost Father’s Day? This year is going by fast. While you’re busy trying to think of the perfect gift for the father or husband in your life ([check out our Father’s Day gift guide!](https://blog.bookroo.com/fathers-day-gift-guide "5 FATHER'S DAY GIFTS THAT ACTUALLY CELEBRATE FATHERHOOD")), we thought it would be fun to share five of our favorite fathers in literature (let’s see if you agree!). Sometimes it’s fun for us to take a break from talking about the kids books (though we love them!) we send in our [children’s book club](https://bookroo.com/ "Bookroo") to talk about other, more advanced books we love._ 

1. **Arthur Weasley**, The _Harry Potter_ Series

    You’ve got to love how playful Arthur Weasley is with his boys. While it sometimes isn’t in line with what Mrs. Weasley thinks should happen, he always tries to please her.

    _Molly Weasley_: *Your* sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night. 
    
    _Arthur Weasley_: [to the boys] Did you really? How did it go? 
    
    _[after Molly hits him]_
    
    _Arthur Weasley_: I mean, that was very wrong indeed, boys. Very wrong of you._ 

2. **Mr. Bennet**, _Pride and Prejudice_
  
    Mr. Bennet is one of my personal favorites. How can you not love him? As a loving, devoted father to the Bennet girls, his rational thinking is one of his prized qualities. You can’t help but love how understanding he is of Lizzy, and how he stands up for his daughter’s dreams, even if he’s a little sarcastic at times.

    _Mr. Bennet: Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins... and I will never see you again if you do._

3. **Atticus Finch**, _To Kill a Mockingbird_

    There’s no better literary father that teaches of honesty and morals than Atticus Finch. He talks plainly with his children and teaches them principles of love and respect.

    _Atticus Finch: First of all," he said, "if you can learn a simple trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view […] until you climb into his skin and walk around in it._​

4. **Jean Valjean**, _Les Miserables_

    While not a biological father, when Valjean adopts Cosette, he is promising to look after her with love and compassion. He was willing to sacrifice his life to save Cosette’s love, Marius, and give Cosette the life she deserves.

    _Victor Hugo: A strange father, forged out of the grandfather, son, brother, and husband that were all in Jean Valjean; a father in whom there was even a mother; a father who loved Cosette and worshipped her, and for whom that child was light, was home, was his homeland, was paradise._

5. **Matthew Cuthbert**, _Anne of Green Gables_

Ok, ok...so Matthew is an unorthodox kind of father. But he is the best father Anne could have asked for! Though he’s quiet, he’s a great listener and shows his love through his actions. He understands the hard life Anne has had and does everything he can to help her have what she’s never had before--a loving family.

_Marilla: I'm not suffering for company, particularly a girl who prattles on without stopping for breath. She's no good for us. She has to go straight back where she came from.
Matthew: Well, we might be of some good to her._
