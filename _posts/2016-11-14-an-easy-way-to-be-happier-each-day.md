A normal day of motherhood for you might include changing dirty diapers, feeding hungry mouths, cleaning messy hands, running multiple errands, and calming temper tantrums. Maybe today was hard, or you might feel like you’re in the “mom funk.” So here’s a fun thought for you to cheer you up if it’s just been one of those days.

Thanksgiving is just around the corner! I mean, come on, pie, mashed potatoes and gravy, turkey, pie, stuffing, more pie…what could be better?

Well, one thing that does make me happier (and will make you happier, too!) than all that delicious food is the reminder throughout the month to be thankful.

I recently came across a blog post by a children’s mental health counselor about her gratitude journal. She has kept one for a few years now, but recently researched the scientific findings of gratitude.

Her findings were that with gratitude:

- You’re happier
- You’re healthier
- You enjoy your kids more
- You become a less angry parent

How, you might ask? First off, research shows that when [you’re more grateful, you have more empathy](http://spp.sagepub.com/content/3/2/232.abstract){:target="_blank"}. [Other](http://spp.sagepub.com/content/3/2/232.abstract){:target="_blank"} [studies](http://www.webmd.com/women/features/gratitute-health-boost#1){:target="_blank"} prove that grateful people tend to take better care of themselves, are less stressed, and have better immune systems. When you’re feeling happier, you won’t get as irritated with the dirty diapers or the messy living room. It will be easier not to yell and to be more patient.

So here is the simple solution to improve as a parent, to be healthier, and to be happier: start a gratitude journal, restart it, or find another way to be intentionally grateful each day. Doesn’t have to be long, hard, or time consuming. Start out easy, with a few bullet points of things that made you happy today. Maybe it was reading with your littles, or a nice text from a friend. Or maybe all you can think of is the delicious Thanksgiving dinner awaiting you next week…whatever it is, be grateful for those little, happy moments!

What made you grateful today? We’d love to hear!
