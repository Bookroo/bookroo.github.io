After seeing pictures and getting feedback about how delighted kids are to receive, open and read their Bookroo books, our favorite thing about this business is getting to peruse TONS of children’s books in order to find ones you might not have heard of before, but have excellent stories, illustrations, and lessons. We wanted to share the fruits of our research with the broader world so that you too can enjoy having these books in your collection!

Here is a list of the 12 board books* we’ve sent out thus far:

- **The Nice Book** by David Ezra Stein
- **Hopper and Wilson** by Maria van Lieshout
- **Owl and Friends** by Joyce Wan
- **Pout-Pout Fish** by Deborah Diesen
- **Hush Little Polar Bear** by Jeff Mack
- **Duck & Goose, 1,2,3** by Tad Hills
