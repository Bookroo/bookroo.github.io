It’s fall now, can you believe it? It seems like yesterday we were all on vacation, soaking up the summer sun. Now you’re back in the normal routine of rushed mornings, work, busy errands, carpooling, and chauffeuring to soccer and dance.

In David Elkind’s book, The Hurried Child, he says something that I absolutely love and that has helped me as I’ve settled back into my own busy routine: 

> “The best things in life are slow.” 

And truly, I think they are. Those moments when you’re reading a book to your little girl before bedtime, or eating ice cream outside in the sun, laughing together as a family, or on a drive down the canyon when the leaves are changing colors.

So here’s a quick note on your busy Monday and a challenge to all you mommas– take the chance each day to slow down and enjoy the moment. Let yourselves enjoy your accomplishments, enjoy the weather (especially the last of the warm sunny days!), enjoy reading time, enjoy someone’s smile, enjoy your family, and enjoy those heart-warming mother moments.

One of my all-time favorite quotes is by Dieter F. Uchtdorf:

> “We would do well to slow down a little, proceed at the optimum speed for our circumstances, focus on the significant…and truly see the things that matter most.”

What slow moments have you loved recently in your life? We’d love to hear!
