We recently read an [article](http://community.today.com/parentingteam/post/actsat-test-prep-tricks-from-a-family-with-three-perfect-scores_1505933651) from a mother who has three children who have scored perfect scores on the ACT/SAT tests. The mother shared 16 tips with readers, ranging from cultivating kindness to making good use of time to getting adequate sleep. The tips are thoughtful and insightful, and the entire article is worth a read, but we'd today we'd like to highlight a few tips in particular. 

**Be Kind**

The mother's first piece of advice was to be kind. She said that her kids would be the first to tell you that's their number one piece of advice. As the mother explained, "[A]wards and scholarships don’t mean a thing if you haven’t made your school a happier place."

**Learn to Juggle**

Learning to jugge, as it turns out, was just one example the mother shared of the confidence kids build when they learn new skills. As the mother stated, "Simply deciding, 'I can do anything' changes everything."

**Buy Books**

Last but not least, the mother shared the importance of buying books. As she said, "[D]on't forget to buy books. Research proves book owners have smarter children . . . When families own books they are much more likely to all read them and discuss concepts and characters (which is where the real learning begins!)." She also recommended physical books over digital books.
