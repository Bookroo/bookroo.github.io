Over the past year I've had the chance to meet and get to know a very impressive individual. Thoughtful, refined, capable. He is a currently a college student. He will be graduating with a degree in business later this year with a near perfect GPA. He has also been studying for the entrance exam to law schools, the formidable LSAT. The highest score you can receive on the LSAT is 180. This year’s incoming Harvard Law School class has the following distribution of LSAT scores: LSAT 75th / 50th / 25th percentiles: 175 / 172 / 170. On practice exams, my friend has been scoring as high as 178. In other words, based on his expected GPA and potential LSAT score, my friend is positioning himself to be a very good candidate for the world’s top law schools.

I recently had the chance to get lunch with my friend. We generally share our current reading list. We were meeting just after Memorial Day weekend, and he had traveled home for the long weekend to visit his family. As we ate, he mentioned that he had brought a big stack of books back to school with him. I wasn’t sure whether he meant like from his local library (which seemed like it could be a pain to return them timely) or from somewhere else. So I asked, “Like from home or something?” He replied that yes, he had brought them from his family’s home. I asked if they had a home library, and he said that they did. Then I asked how large the library was. His response? In a very humble manner, he responded that they probably had over 5,000 books in their home library.

That is amazing! We’ve written before about how the mere presence of books in a home can help a child perform at reading levels whole grades ahead of their peers. As we explained in that article, the Oxford University Press published a study showing that the “gain from a 500-book home library rather than from a one-book library is equivalent to the gain of somewhere between one or two additional years in school (for Finland, the Netherlands, Canada, etc.) and three additional years (for Hungary, Germany, the UK, etc.). In the United States, the gain is about two-and-a-half years.”

I was extremely impressed yet not entirely surprised to discover that my friend grew up in a home that understood in the importance of reading and invested in a home library that now has more than several thousand books. Instead, the revelation was confirming to me of the power of reading and books. Of course, I thought to myself, his intellect, culture, and confidence in life was shaped by reading. I don’t meant to discredit his or his parent’s efforts in other areas, but I believe his is a great example of the power of raising readers.

Now, building a home library that numbers in the thousands is not something many of us can do overnight. Instead, it’s a process of consistent effort. As the saying goes, “If you want to be successful, be consistent.” Monthly children’s book clubs and children’s book subscriptions offer a wonderful option for building your child’s library over time. At Bookroo, we work hard to select quality books to send to you each month to help you build in your child’s library consistently and conveniently month by month.
